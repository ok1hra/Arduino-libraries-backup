 *
 * To be used with M5Stack SD Menu https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater
 * This sketch is useless without a precompiled "menu.bin" saved on the SD Card.
 * You may compile menu.bin from the M5Stack-SD-Menu sketch.
 *
 * Just use this sketch as your boilerplate and code your app over it, then
 * compile it and put the binary on the sdcard. See M5Stack-SD-Menu for more
 * info on the acceptable file formats.
 *
 * When this app is in memory, booting the M5StickC with the Button A pushed will
 * flash back the menu.bin into memory.
